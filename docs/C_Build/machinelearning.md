### Natural Language Processing for Enteprise Architecture

*Machine Learning (ML)* is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. ML is impacting each day more and more industries. Each day, more services and products are getting impacted by ML technology. However, lack of relevant Business Data for creating and training custom business models is preventing us for using ML in more industries.

*Natural Langugage Processing* could help use to mine the Business Data we need to scaffolding a company **Enterprise Architecture**.

Companies such as *IBM* or others, have resourced to develop fake datasets to test NLP modles. Other companies such as Google have developed algorithms for assisting companies to develop their own datasets.  
This is one of the reasons why *Data Science* could become a Billion dollar industry.

Probably you are familiar with tools such as **Microsoft Office Excel** or **Microsoft Office Powerpoint**. Even you have already used Data Visualization tools such as *Tableau*, *Qlik Sense* or *Microsoft Power BI*. These tools are useful for Basic Analytics or Data Visualization. however, they have limitations specially when we introduce **Natural Language Processing** in our activities.

The objective of these blogs is to introduce how to use **Natural Language Processing** in our daily activities. Although the cases used are mainly referred to **Enteprise Architecture**.
